# Flower Image Classification

This project demonstrates image classification using deep learning, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The goal is to build a model that can classify images of flowers into five different categories: daisy, dandelion, roses, sunflowers, and tulips.

## Dataset

The project utilizes a publicly available dataset of about 3,700 photos of flowers, categorized into five sub-directories, one per class. The dataset can be downloaded from TensorFlow Datasets.

## Model

The model is built using the Keras library and consists of convolutional layers, pooling layers, and a dense output layer. The model is trained using a training dataset and validated using a validation dataset.

## Results

The model achieves high accuracy on the validation dataset. It is also able to classify new images of flowers with reasonable accuracy.

## Usage

To run the project, you will need to install the TensorFlow and Keras libraries. Then, you can run the Colab notebook that contains the project code.
